\section{discussion}
In comparison to the before mentioned murine antibodies
HIG preparations have the advantage of absence of a
HAMA response. As a spin-off of research on monoclonal
antibodies specific for unique antigens on Pseudomonas
aeruginosa bacteria, Rubin et al. [85] discovered
serendipitously that human non-specific polyclonal immunoglobulin
G (IgG) in their rat model of infection
provided results similar to those for a specific monoclonal
antibody. Although there are differences between radiolabelled
monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal IgG in
terms of origin (murine or human), specificity, dynamic
biodistribution, mechanism of action etc., there are also
many similarities between these radioimmunoconjugates
as agents for detecting infection and inflammation
